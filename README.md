It reached over 100 users at its peak, per Google Analytics, a number that includes a large majority of the corporate office workers in addition to employees in nearby Blinds To Go showrooms and traveling (Shop-at-home) employees, who might stop in for a bite at lunchtime if the daily catering suited them.

## Notes

This app was originally built for employees at Blind’s To Go’s Paramus office, but it is an independent personal project. Blind’s To Go is not responsible for its content or use.

This repository was reorganized in January 2025 to simplify the folder structure (originally created with create-react-app). During that process, commit history was reset, but the project was actively developed from March 2023 through January 2025.
