## Notes

This app was originally built for employees at Blindâ€™s To Goâ€™s Paramus office, but it is an independent personal project. Blindâ€™s To Go is not responsible for its content or use.

This repository was reorganized in January 2025 to simplify the folder structure (originally created with create-react-app). During that process, commit history was reset, but the project was actively developed from March 2023 through January 2025.
